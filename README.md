# 🔤 Stock Picker

This is the eighth project from [The Odin Project](https://github.com/TheOdinProject) curriculum — a console-based implementation of stock_picker method that takes in an array of stock prices, one for each hypothetical day. It should return a pair of days representing the best day to buy and the best day to sell. Days start at 0.
